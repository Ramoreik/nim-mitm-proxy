# Simple Nim HTTP Proxy

I'm currently trying to learn how proxies work.

This project will try to implement a MITM proxy, meaning HTTP and HTTPS requests will be able to be inspected and modified to resend them.

There will also be an attempt at supporting Websockets proxying and an implementation of SOCKS(unsure about this one since it's time consuming)

Feel free to copy and modify for your uses, the quality of the code is not garanteed, since this is a learning project.
