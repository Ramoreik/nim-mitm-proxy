# inspiration taken from: https://xmonader.github.io/nimdays/day15_tcprouter.html
# by inspiration I mean it saved me hours of trial and error since i'm dumb.

# This project is to learn the concepts involved in HTTP/HTTPS proxying, Websockets proxying and SOCKS. 

# to MITM, i have to place myself as the remote client, when im tunnelling.
# meaning:
# 1 - I wrap the socket intented for the remote server with my ssl context
# 2 - I start another socket and i negotiate ssl to the actual target
# 3 - I tunnel the two and I can read the data in the tunnel.
# NOTE: For this to work I also have to generate certs on the fly, implemented poorly for now.

# TODO: Fix Edgecases:
    # FIXME: fix edgecase in www.jumpstart.com, site doesn't load for some reason.
    # FIXME: Investigate weird crash on youtube when browsing videos, only on macos apparently.
# TODO: See if data is encoded before writing the interaction, if it is, unencode it. EX gzip.
